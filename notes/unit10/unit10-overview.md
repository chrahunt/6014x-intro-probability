Markov chains are a class of **random processes** that satisfy the Markov property.

The future can be predicted based only on the current state, independent of its past and future

Many uses and applications:
statistical mechanics
signal processing
coding
data compression
pattern recognition
queuing theory
page ranking
make Bayesian inference more practical as Markov chain Monte Carlo.
finance: describe asset price evolution

only cover discrete time Markov chains within finite state of spaces

long run behavior
when do chains exhibit steady state behavior, and when is that independent of starting state?

classical application associated with phone system design
calculate interesting quantities
