# Overview

3 lectures
limit theorems
intro to classical statistics

limit theorems are useful when dealing with a large number of random variables, by taking the limit as the number of r.vs goes to infinity

Lecture 1: weak law of large numbers
lerge number of i.i.d

lecture 2: central limit theoren
sum of i.i.d

estimating the unknown mean of a certain distribution and accuracy of the estimates

we make no assumptions on the unknown quantity, unknown context. Non-bayes/classical statistics

lecture 3: basic elements of classical statistics
sample-mean based estimators
general methods
